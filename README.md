# FDFD_modules
personal set of FDFD codes used for my research. Much of this has been inspired by Yu (Jerry) Shi and Wonseok Shin

## Dispersive 2D mode-solvers/eigen solvers
New type of mode solvers which can be used for 2 dimensional structures, based on the paper shown here
https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-40-6-1053

## 3D Solver with acceleration and enhancements
uses a power reformulation of Maxwell's equations based on the Beltrami-Laplace operator shown here: http://www.mit.edu/~wsshin/pdf/shin2013oe.pdf

tested on 60x60x60 grids on a laptop and QMR and runs reasonably quick
